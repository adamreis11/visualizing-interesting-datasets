Visualizing two datasets
# Project 02: Visualizing Interesting Datasets

This project explores two datasets using Python and pandas, and visualizes them with matplotlib. The goal is to analyze the data and present insights clearly through two different types of plots.

## Plot 1: Bookings Data (Scatter Plot)

![Bookings Scatter Plot](Bookings_plot.png)

This scatter plot visualizes the Bookings dataset, which contains data on Uber bookings and cancellations. Each point represents a booking, allowing us to see patterns and trends in cancellations versus completed bookings. The x-axis and y-axis are clearly labeled to make the relationship between the variables easy to interpret.

## Plot 2: Student Performance Data (Line Plot)

This line plot shows trends in the Student Performance dataset over time or across different categories. Two data sources are plotted together for comparison, allowing us to track differences in performance patterns. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled clearly to ensure readability.
